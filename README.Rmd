The goal of committee_assigment is to expediate the creation of *balanced* committee assignments given a handful of *constraints*.

## Objectives & Constraints

overall population as whole.  This means controlling for certain variables, such as 
gender, occupation, region, etc.

The largest constraint are:

* Gender (ensure balanced gender representation)
* Job (ensure each Job role is equally represented)
* Region (ensure representation from each region, try to balance it)
